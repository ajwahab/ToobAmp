/********************************************************
 * class PitchDetector - pitch detector optimized for use as in a guitar tuner.
 *
 * PitchDetector currently only works with a sample rate of 22050, or 24000hz.
 * (There are manually fittted adjustments that improve pitch accuracy which
 * currently can't be accounted for in closed form).
 *
 * Downssampling is neccessary both for efficiency and stability. Running
 * pitch detection at higher sample rates does not increase accuracy,
 * and introduces instability problems that are not present at lower sample
 * rates.
 *
 * Ideally you should decimate your audio signal after running it through a
 * suitable lowpass anti-aliasing filter. Setting the anti-aliasing filter
 * fC to 1200hz would not be wrong, as the pitch detector doesn't work
 * well above that frequency.
 *
 * Measured accuracy: stable tuning with ~0.1 cents accuracy in normal guitar
 * tuning range. Less than 1 cent below high-e 12th fret, with osciallations
 * due to phase errors increasing above the 12th fret. You could filter to
 * reduce those oscillations if you REALLY need pitch detection in that range.
 *
 * NOT suitable for use on a realtime thread!

     * @brief Pitch Detector
     * 
     * PitchDetector is tuned for use as a guitar tuner. It detects the MIDI pitch of monophonic audio input data.
     * 
     * For best results, run PitchDetector at 22050 or 24000 Hz. Higher sample rates are not more accurate, 
     * are less noise-tolerant, and are O(n log(n)) more expensive to execute.
     * 
     * For best results, call PitchDector(sampleRate), or Initialize(sampleRate), and call PitchDetector::getFftSize()
     * to determine how much data has to be in the audio buffer supplied to detectPitch(). These overrides 
     * select an optimal size for the buffers. Currently, buffers are 4096 samples at 22050 or 24000Hz, but that may change in 
     * future releases, and increase linearly to the next power of 2 with higher sample rates.
     * 
     * PitchDetector typically requires about a fifth of a second of audio data. If you need updates at 
     * a faster rate, you may need to do overlapped calls to detectPitch. i.e. new audio data with enough 
     * old audio data to pad the buffer out to the correct size.
     * 
     * PitchDetector currently selects a buffer size of 4096 samples when running at 22050 or 24000Hz. This 
     * may change in future revisions of PitchDetector.
     * 
     * PitchDetector currently uses ceptstrum pitch detection to find the fundamental frequency of the input signal.
     * This provides an approximate pitch, which is then refined using Grandke interpolation.
     * 
     * Tested accuracy:  +/- 0.001 cents with no signal noise. Less than 0.1 cent with less than -35db SNR. Less than 1 cent 
     * with very occasional errors with less than -30db SNR. Range: 80hz to 993hz (range of a guitar from low E to 19th fret on 
     * the high E string).
