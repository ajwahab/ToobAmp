# ToobAmp LV2 Guitar Amp Plugins

v1.1.43

ToobAmp LV2 plugins are a set of high-quality guitar effect plugins for Raspberry Pi. They are specifically designed for use with the [PiPedal](https://github.com/rerdavies/pipedal) project, but work perfectly well with any LV2 Plugin host.

# Releases Notes

v1.1.43 now provides native interfaces on hosts other than PiPedal.

## Install ToobAmp

Do NOT install ToobAmp over an existing PiPedal install. PiPedal install packages include the best versions of PiPedal plugins already.

ToobAmp v1.1.43 has only been tested on Rasberry PI OS 64-bit bookworm. You can download a .deb install package here:

* [Rasberry PI OS 64-bit bookworm or later](https://github.com/rerdavies/ToobAmp/releases/download/v1.1.43/toobamp_1.1.43_arm64.deb)

This release is currently being tested on Ubuntu. Expect install packages for Ubuntu shortly. If you want to try ToobAmp on Ubuntu in the 
meantime, you can build the package from  source. If you encounter problems on Ubuntu, feel free to log bug reports.

If you are using a different platform, you may want to consider using the following install packages, although the plugins in these packages do not
have native UIs.

* [Ubuntu 21.04 or later; Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit (bullseye) ](https://github.com/rerdavies/ToobAmp/releases/download/v1.0.17/toobamp_1.0.17_arm64.deb)

* [Ubuntu 21.04 or later; amd64/x64](https://github.com/rerdavies/ToobAmp/releases/download/v1.0.17/toobamp_1.0.17_amd64.deb)

Run the following shell commands:

    sudo apt update
    cd ~/Downloads
    sudo dpkg -i ./toobamp_1.1.43_arm64.deb

## Building ToobAmp

##### Prerequisites

Run the following commands to install prerequisites:

     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install -y build-essential
     sudo apt install -y cmake ninja-build
     sudo apt install -y lv2-dev libboost-iostreams-dev libflac++-dev zlib1g-dev libdbus-1-dev
     sudo apt install -y libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev catch2 librsvg2-dev liblilv-dev  libxrandr-dev
     


Clone the repository to your local machine.

In the project directory, run:

     git submodule update --init --recursive

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you will still need to perform the previous command after 
cloning the project, since Visual Studio Code does not yet understand submodules.

##### Building 

ToobAmp was built using Visual Studio Code, with CMake build files, so it's easier to configure and build 
TooBAmp if you are using Visual Studio Code.

If you are using Visual Studio code, install the Microsoft CMake extension, and load the project directory. Visual Studio Code
will automatically detect and configure the project. Build and configuration tools for the CMake project can be accessed on the Visual Studio Code status bar.

If you are not usings Visual Studio Code, the following shell scripts, found in the root of the project, can be used to configure, build and install the project:

    ./config.sh     #configure the CMake project
   
    ./build.sh   # build the project.
    
After a full build, run the following command to install ToobAmp:

    ./install.sh
	
To build the debian package, run

    ./makePackage

Please relocate components, and package information if you're going to permanently fork ToobAmp to ensure that 
Debian packages don't conflict with each other.

If you are building the plugins for use with a host other than PiPedal, you should read this:
